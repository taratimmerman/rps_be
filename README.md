# Rock-Paper-Scissors API

Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors API repository! This is the backend for my Rock-Paper-Scissors app, currently in development.

## Getting Started

To set up your Phoenix server:

1. Run `mix setup` to install and set up dependencies.
2. Start the Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`.

Visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser to interact with the API.

## Development Information

This API is part of an ongoing project to create a Rock-Paper-Scissors app. As development progresses, more features and documentation will be added.
